I am a PhD student in Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning at Gatsby Unit where I work under the supervision of Prof. [Maneesh Sahani](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~maneesh/). Broadly speaking, I use and develop mathematical and statistical tools to address brain related questions with a particular interest on latent variable models and neural spiking data analysis.

Before starting my PhD, I received a MSc in mathematics and system engineering from École Polytechnique (France - 'Engineer Program') and a Msc in bioengineering at EPFL (Switzerland).

Thanks to a [Bertarelli Fellowship](https://bertarelli.hms.harvard.edu/bertarelli-fellows), I then worked with Prof. [Emery Brown](https://picower.mit.edu/emery-n-brown) and Prof. [Patrick Purdon](https://purdonlab.mgh.harvard.edu/) as a data analyst and research assistant in the Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory (Harvard-MIT) and the Purdon's Laboratory (Harvard-MGH). During this time, I developed methods to study cross-frequency coupled EEG signals and simultaneous fMRI recordings aiming at characterizing the mechanism of general anaesthesia on human subjects.
