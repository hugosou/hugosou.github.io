I am a PhD student in Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning at Gatsby Unit where I work under the supervision of Prof. [Maneesh Sahani](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~maneesh/), I use and develop mathematical and statistical tools to address brain related questions with a particular interest on latent variable models and neural spiking data analysis. 

Before starting my PhD, I received a MSc in mathematics and system engineering from École Polytechnique (France - 'Engineer Program') followed by a double Msc in bioengineering at EPFL (Switzerland). There, I received a Bertarelli Fellowship allowing me to work two years with Prof. Emery Brown and Prof. Patrick Purdon as a data analyst and research assistant in the Neuroscience Statistics Research Laboratory (Harvard-MIT) and the Purdon's Laboratory (Harvard-MGH). During this time, I developed methods to study cross-frequency coupled EEG signals and simultaneous fMRI recordings aiming at characterizing the mechanism of general anaesthesia on human subjects.
